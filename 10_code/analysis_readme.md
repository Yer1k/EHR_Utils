## Assumption of the files:

- The patient and lab data are stored in separate files.

- The patient data file contains demographic information for each patient, including their date of birth, date of death (if applicable), and other demographic information such as gender and race.

- The lab data file contains laboratory test results for each patient, including the test name, date of the test, and the test result value.

- Each patient has a unique identifier in the form of a PatientID.

- The date and time fields in both files are formatted as dates and times in the format "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS".

- The data in the files is considered to be complete and accurate for the purposes of this parsing.
